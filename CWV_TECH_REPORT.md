# CWV Tech Report

## Structure

### HTML

All the HTML files are located in the `templates/techreport` folder. The top level files in that folder are the main pages that will be rendered. The `components` subfolder contains reusable bits of HTML that can be included in the pages and templates. The `templates` subfolder contains `<template>`s used in (web)components.
